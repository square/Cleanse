Cleanse is a `dependency injection`_ framework for Swift. It is designed from the ground-up with *developer experience*
in mind. It takes inspiration from both `Dagger`_ and `Guice`_.

Cleanse is currently in *beta* phase. This means its API is subject to change (but for the better).

DOCS ARE BEING UPDATED!
-----------------------
This documentation is out of date but fear not, we are in the process of updating it. The CleanseGithubBrowser example
is up to date and compiling, so please refer to that until this is updated.

Getting Started
---------------
This is a quick guide on how to get started using Cleanse in your application.

A full-fledged example of using Cleanse with Cocoa Touch can be found in ``Examples/CleanseGithubBrowser``

Installation
````````````
Cleanse can be added to your project multiple ways. How to add it, depends on your environment (whether using Xcode
or the open source toolchain) as well as what your preferred dependency management software.

Using Xcode
~~~~~~~~~~~
``Cleanse.xcodeproj`` can be dragged and dropped into an existing project or workspace in Xcode.
One may add ``Cleanse.framework`` as a target dependency and embed it.

Using `Carthage`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cleanse should be able to be configured with `Carthage`_. One should be able to follow the
`Adding Frameworks to an Application`_ from `Carthage's README`_ to successfully do this.

.. _Adding Frameworks to an Application: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application
.. _Carthage's README: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md
.. _Carthage: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/

Using `Swift Package Manager`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cleanse can be used with `Swift Package Manager`_. The following a definition that can be added to the dependencies
of a ``Project`` declaration.

.. code-block:: swift

  .Package(
    url: "https://github.com/square/cleanse.git",
    versions: Version(0,1,0)..<Version(1,0,0)
  ),

.. _Swift Package Manager: https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager


Using Cleanse
`````````````
The Cleanse API is in a Swift module called ``Cleanse`` (surprised?). To use any of its API in a file, at the top,
one must import it.

.. code-block:: swift

  import Cleanse

Defining a Component and Root Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cleanse will build a graph of objects, however, when we build the object graph, we only get one type back, which we
call a "Root". In a Cocoa Touch application, our root object is logically the App Delegate, however we don't control
construction of that, so we have to use `Property Injection`_ to populate the required properties in our App Delegate.

.. note::

  `Property Injection`_ should be used only when absolutely necessary
  (when we don't control the construction of a type)

Let's start by defining the Root ``Component``:

.. code-block:: swift

  extension AppDelegate {
    struct Component : Cleanse.Component {
      // When we call AppComponent().build() it will return the Root type if successful
      typealias Root = PropertyInjector<AppDelegate>

      func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
          // Will fill out contents later
      }
    }
  }

Now, in our App Delegate we should add:

.. code-block:: swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        // Build our component, and make the property injector
        let propertyInjector = try! Component().build()

         // Now inject the properties into ourselves
        propertyInjector.injectProperties(into: self)

        window!.makeKeyAndVisible()

        return true
    }

Now, if we ran the app as is, it would blow up. We haven't told cleanse how to make a `PropertyInjector<AppDelegate>`,
so let's do that. For the simplest app delegates, we need to populate just one property:

.. code-block:: swift

    var window: UIWindow?

Even though we can configure property injection with closures, it is generally cleaner to make a method that sets the
properties. Let's define a method like:

.. code-block:: swift

  extension AppDelegate {
    /// Requests the main window and sets it
    func injectProperties(window: UIWindow) {
      self.window = window
    }
  }

And add the following to ``AppDelegate.Component.configure``

.. code-block:: swift

    func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
          binder
            .bindPropertyInjectionOf(AppDelegate.self)
            .to(injector: AppDelegate.injectProperties)
    }

This tells Cleanse to use the ``AppDelegate.injectProperties()`` function when a ``PropertyInjector<AppDelegate>`` is
requested.


Satisfying Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running the app now, would yield a new error saying a provider for ``UIWindow`` is missing. That's because we haven't
configured it.

A ``Module`` in Cleanse is similar to a ``Component`` but doesn't define a root object, ``Component``\ s can *install*
``Module``\ s and ``Modules``\ s can install other ``Modules`` using ``binder.install(module:)``.

Let's define a module that creates our main window. The following will declare `UIWindow` as a singleton.

.. code-block:: swift

  extension UIWindow {
    struct Module : Cleanse.Module {
      public func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
        binder
          .bind(UIWindow.self)
          .asSingleton()
          .to { (rootViewController: TaggedProvider<UIViewController.Root>) in
            let window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)
            window.rootViewController = rootViewController.get()
            return window
          }
      }
    }
  }

and in our ``AppDelegate.Component.configure`` method we want to install this module by adding

.. code-block:: swift

  binder.install(module: UIWindow.Module())

We have satisfied the dependency for our App Delegate (``UIWindow``), but we have a new dependency,
``TaggedProvider<UIViewController.Root>``. The ``TaggedProvider<UIViewController.Root>`` represents a "special" view
controller which can be read about in `Type Tags`_. The Tag, ``UIViewController.Root`` should be defined as:

.. code-block:: swift

  extension UIViewController {
    /// This will represent the rootViewController that is assigned to our main window
    public struct Root : Tag {
      public typealias Element = UIViewController
    }
  }

And now we have one last dependency to satisfy, our root view controller. For this example, let's just make a simple
view controller:

.. code-block:: swift

  /// Root View Controller for our application
  class RootViewController : UIViewController {
    /// Initializer we want to use. Can add more arguments to this if wanted
    init() {
      super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }

    /// We declare this unavailable. This makes it so its unambiguous when referring to `RootViewController.init`
    /// we get the constructor we want
    @available(*, unavailable)
    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
      fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      // Set up your view here!
    }
  }

And we'll want to make a module to configure it:

.. code-block:: swift

  extension RootViewController {
    /// Configures RootViewController
    struct Module : Cleanse.Module {
      func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
        // Configures the RootViewController to be provided by the initializer
        binder
          .bind()
          .to(factory: RootViewController.init)

        // This satisfies UIWindow depending on TaggedProvider<UIViewController.Root>
        // The actual root is our RootViewController wrapped in a UINavigationController
        binder
          .bind()
          .tagged(with: UIViewController.Root.self)
          .to { UINavigationController(rootViewController: $0 as RootViewController) }
      }
    }
  }

and in our ``AppDelegate.Component.configure`` method we want to install this module by adding

.. code-block:: swift

  binder.install(module: RootViewController.Module())


Now, all of our dependencies should be satisfied and the app should launch successfully.

As the functionality of this app grows, one may add arguments to RootViewController and its dependencies as well as more
modules to satisfy them.

As previously mentioned, it may be worth taking a look at our `example app`_ to see a more full-featured example.

.. _example app: https://github.com/square/Cleanse/tree/master/Examples/CleanseGithubBrowser

Core Concepts & Data Types
--------------------------

``Provider``\ /\ ``ProviderProtocol``
`````````````````````````````````````

Has a method that returns a value of its containing type. Serves same functionality as Java's `javax.inject.Provider`_.

``Provider`` and ``TaggedProvider`` (see below) implement ``ProviderProtocol`` protocol which is defined as:

.. code-block:: swift

    public protocol ProviderProtocol {
        associatedtype Element
        func get() -> Element
    }

.. _javax.inject.Provider: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Provider.html

Type Tags
`````````

In a given component, there may be the desire to provide or require different instances of common types with different
significances. Perhaps we need to distinguish the base URL of our API server from the URL of our temp directory.

In Java, this is done with annotations, in particular ones annotated with `@Qualifier`_. In Go, this can be accomplished
with `tags on structs`_ of fields.

.. _@Qualifier:  https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Qualifier.html
.. _tags on structs: https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#StructTag

In Cleanse's system a type annotation is equivalent to an implementation of the Tag protocol:

.. code-block:: swift

    public protocol Tag {
        associatedtype Element
    }

The `associatedtype`_, ``Element``, indicates what type the tag is valid to apply to. This is very different than annotations
in Java used as qualifiers in Dagger and Guice which cannot be constrained by which type they apply to.

In Cleanse, the ``Tag`` protocol is implemented to distinguish a type, and the ``TaggedProvider`` is used to wrap a value of
``Tag.Element``. Since most of the library refers to ``ProviderProtocol``, ``TaggedProvider`` is accepted almost everywhere a
``Provider`` is.

Its definition is almost identical to ``Provider`` aside from an additional generic argument:

.. code-block:: swift

    struct TaggedProvider<Tag : Cleanse.Tag> : ProviderProtocol {
        func get() -> Tag.Element
    }

Example
~~~~~~~

Say one wanted to indicate a URL type, perhaps the base URL for the API endpoints, one could define a tag this way:

.. code-block:: swift

    public struct PrimaryAPIURL : Tag {
        typealias Element = NSURL
    }

Then one may be able to request a ``TaggedProvider`` of this special URL by using the type:

.. code-block:: swift

    TaggedProvider<PrimaryAPIURL>

If we had a class that requires this URL to perform a function, the constructor could be defined like:


.. code-block:: swift

    class SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall {
        let primaryURL: NSURL
        init(primaryURL: TaggedProvider<PrimaryAPIURL>) {
            self.primaryURL = primaryURL.get()
        }
    }

This would be the equivalent in Java using ``javax.inject`` annotations:

.. code-block:: java

    @Qualifier @interface PrimaryAPIURL {
    }
    // ...
    class SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall {
       @Inject SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall(@PrimaryAPIURL String primaryURL) {
           this.primaryURL = primaryURL
       }
    }

Unlike java’s annotation system, ``Tag``\s cannot have constants in them (there is no equivalent of
``@Named("omgponies")``), however, the creation of new Tags in cleanse is much lighter weight and encourages
better practices.

Modules
```````

Modules in Cleanse serve a similar purpose to Modules in other DI systems such as Dagger or Guice.
Modules are building blocks for one's object graph. Using modules in Cleanse may look very similar to those
familiar with Guice since configuration is done at runtime and the binding DSL is very inspired by Guice's.

The ``Module`` protocol has a single method, ``configure(binder:)``, and is is defined as:

.. code-block:: swift

    protocol Module {
        func configure<B : Binder>(binder: B)
    }

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Configuration of modules is further elaborated on below

Providing the Base API URL
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: swift

    struct PrimaryAPIURLModule : Module {
      func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
        binder
          .bind(NSURL.self)
          .tagged(with: PrimaryAPIURL.self)
          .to(value: NSURL(string: "https://connect.squareup.com/v2/")!)
      }
    }

Consuming the Primary API URL (e.g. "https://connect.squareup.com/v2/")
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

    It seems to be a good pattern to embed the ``Module`` that configures X as an inner struct of X named ``Module``. To
    disambiguate Cleanse's Module protocol from the inner struct being defined, one has to qualify the protocol with
    ``Cleanse.Module``


.. code-block:: swift

    class SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall {
        let primaryURL: NSURL
        init(primaryURL: TaggedProvider<PrimaryAPIURL>) {
            self.primaryURL = primaryURL.get()
        }
        struct Module : Cleanse.Module {
            func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
                binder
                    .bind(SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall.self)
                    .to(factory: SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall.init)
            }
        }
    }

Root Component
``````````````
Unlike Guice and Dagger1, there is no ObjectGraph/Injector object that one can pull arbitrary instances out of.

Cleanse has a concept of a ``Component``. A ``Component`` is essentially a ``Module``, but with an `associated type`_
named ``Root``. The ``Root`` asosociated type in a component is the *Root* of the object graph. An instance of ``Root``
is what's returned when a ``Component`` is constructed. It also may be referred to as an "entry point",

The component protocol is defined as:

.. code-block:: swift

    public protocol Component : Module {
        associatedtype Root
    }

The outermost component of an object graph (e.g. the Root component), is built by the ``build()`` method.
This is defined as the following protocol extension:

.. code-block:: swift

    public extension Component {
        /// Builds the component and returns the root object.
        public func build() throws -> Self.Root
    }

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Defining a component
""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: swift

    struct RootAPI {
        let somethingUsingTheAPI: SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall
    }

    struct APIComponent : Component {

        func configure<B : Binder>(binder binder: B) {
            // "install" the modules that create the component
            binder.install(module: PrimaryAPIURLModule())
            binder.install(module: SomethingThatDoesAnAPICall.Module())
            // bind our root Object
            binder
                .bind(RootAPI.self)
                .to(factory: RootAPI.init)
        }
    }

.. code-block:: swift

    let root = try! APIComponent().build()

Binder
``````
A ``Binder`` instance is what is passed to ``Module.configure(binder:)`` which module implementations use to configure
their providers.

Binders have two core methods that one will generally interface with. The first, and simpler one, is the install method.
One passes it an instance of a module to be installed.  It is used like:

.. code-block:: swift

  binder.install(module: PrimaryAPIURLModule())

It essentially tells the binder to call ``configure(binder:)`` on ``PrimaryAPIURLModule``.

The other core method that binders expose is the ``bind<E>(type: E.Type)``. This is the entry point to configure a
binding. The bind methods takes one argument, which the `metattype`_ of the element being configured. ``bind()``
returns a ``BindingBuilder`` that one must call methods on to complete the configuration of the binding that was
initiated.

``bind()`` and subsequent builder methods that are not *terminating* are annotated with ``@warn_unused_result``
to prevent errors by only partially configuring a binding.

.. _metattype: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html#//apple_ref/swift/grammar/metatype-type

.. Note::

  The ``type`` argument of ``bind()`` has a default and can be inferred and omitted in some common cases.
  In this documentation we sometimes specify it explicitly to improve readability.


``BindingBuilder`` and Configuring Your Bindings
````````````````````````````````````````````````

The BindingBuilder is a fluent API for configuring your bindings. It is built in a way that guides one through the
process of configuring a binding through code completion. A simplified grammar for the DSL of ``BindingBuilder`` is::

  binder
    .bind([Element.self])                // Bind Step
   [.tagged(with: Tag_For_Element.self)] // Tag step
   [.asSingleton()]                      // Scope step
   {.to(provider:) |                     // Terminating step
    .to(factory:)  |
    .to(value:)}

Bind Step
~~~~~~~~~
This starts the binding process to define how an instance of ``Element`` is created

Tag Step (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An optional step that indicates that the provided type should actually be
``TaggedProvider<Element>`` and not just ``Provider<Element>``.

.. seealso::

  `Type Tags`_ for more information


Scope Step (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, whenever an object is requested, Cleanse constructs a new one.
If `.asSingleton()` is specified, Cleanse will memoize and return the same instance in the scope of the ``Component``
it was configured in.

In the future we may want to allow a class conforming to protocol (possibly named ``Singleton``) to indicate that it
should be bound as a singleton. It is tracked by `this issue`_

.. _this issue: https://github.com/square/Cleanse/issues/3

Terminating Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To finish configuring a binding, one *must* invoke one of the terminating methods on ``BindingBuilder``.
There are multiple methods that are considered terminating steps. The common ones are described below.

Dependency-Free Terminating methods
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a category of terminating methods that configure how to instantiate elements that don't have dependencies
on other instances configured in the object graph.

Terminating Method: ``to(provider: Provider<E>)``
#################################################
Other terminating methods funnel into this. If the binding of ``Element`` is terminated with this variant,
``.get()`` will be invoked on the on the provider argument when an instance of ``Element`` is requested.

Terminating Method: ``to(value: E)``
####################################
This is a convenience method. It is semantically equivalent to
``.to(provider: Provider(value: value))`` or ``.to(factory: { value })``. It may
offer performance advantages in the future, but currently doesn't.

Terminating Method: ``to(factory: () -> E)`` *(0th arity)*
##########################################################
This takes a closure instead of a provider, but is otherwise equivalent. Is equivalent to ``.to(provider: Provider(getter: factory))``


Dependency-Requesting Terminating Methods
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is how we define requirements for bindings.
`Dagger 2`_ determines requirements at compile time by looking at the arguments of ``@Provides`` methods and ``@Inject`` constructors.
`Guice`_ does something similar, but using reflection to determine arguments.
One can explicitly request a dependency from Guice's binder via the `getProvider()`_ method.

.. _getProvider(): https://google.github.io/guice/api-docs/latest/javadoc/com/google/inject/Binder.html#getProvider-java.lang.Class-
.. _Dagger 2: https://google.github.io/dagger/

Unlike Java, Swift doesn't have annotation processors to do this at compile time, nor does it have a `stable` reflection
API. We also don't want to expose a `getProvider()`_-like method since it allows one to do dangerous things and
also one loses important information on which providers depend on other providers.

Swift does, however, have a very powerful generic system. We leverage this to provide safety and simplicity when
creating our bindings.

Terminating Methods: ``to<P1>(factory: (P1) -> E)`` *(1st arity)*
#################################################################

This registers a binding of E to the factory function which takes one argument.

.. admonition:: How it works

  Say we have a hamburger defined as:

  .. code-block:: swift

     struct Hamburger {
        let topping: Topping
        // Note: this actually would be created implicitly for structs
        init(topping: Topping) {
          self.topping = topping
        }
      }

  When one references the initializer without calling it (e.g. ``let factory = Hamburger.init``),
  the expression results in a `function type`_ of

  .. code-block:: swift

     (topping: Topping) -> Hamburger

  So when configuring its creation in a module, calling

  .. code-block:: swift

     binder.bind(Hamburger.self).to(factory: Hamburger.init)

  will result in calling the ``.to<P1>(factory: (P1) -> E)`` terminating function and resolve ``Element``
  to ``Hamburger`` and ``P1`` to ``Topping``.

  A pseudo-implementation of this ``to(factory:)``:

  .. code-block:: swift

    public func to<P1>(factory: (P1) -> Element) {
      // Ask the binder for a provider of P1. This provider
      // is invalid until the component is constructed
      // Note that getProvider is an internal method, unlike in Guice.
      // It also specifies which binding this provider is for to
      // improve debugging.
      let dependencyProvider1: Provider<P1> =
          binder.getProvider(P1.self, requiredFor: Element.self)

      // Create a Provider of Element. This will call the factory
      // method with the providers
      let elementProvider: Provider<Element> = Provider {
          factory(dependencyProvider1.get())
      }

      // Call the to(provider:) terminating function to finish
      // this binding
      to(provider: elementProvider)
    }

  Since the requesting of the dependent providers happen at configuration time, the object graph is aware of all
  the bindings and dependencies at configuration time and will fail fast.


.. _function type: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH31-ID449


Terminating Methods: ``to<P1, P2, … PN>(factory: (P1, P2, … PN) -> E)`` *(Nth arity)*
#####################################################################################

Well, we may have more than one requirement to construct a given instance.
There aren't `variadic generics`_ in swift. However we used a small script to generate various arities of the
``to(factory:)`` methods.

.. _variadic generics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_template

Collection Bindings
```````````````````
It is sometimes desirable to provide multiple objects of the same type into one collection. A very common use of
this would be providing interceptors or filters to an RPC library.
In an app, one may want to add to a set of view controllers of a tab bar controller, or setttings in a settings page.

This concept is referred to as *Multibindings*
`in Dagger <http://google.github.io/dagger/multibindings.html>`_
and
`in Guice <https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Multibindings>`_.

Unlike Dagger and Guice where one can provide elements to both a ``Set`` and ``Map``,
Cleanse will only allow one to provide elements into an ``Array``. The choice of ``Array`` is because unlike
Java where every type of object can be part of a ``Set``, only types that are ``Hashable`` can be part of a ``Set``
in Swift. This requirement would make it not useful in many cases.

.. Note::

  Providing to a Set or Dictionary is not an unwanted feature and could probably be built as an
  extension on top of providing to ``Arrays``.

Binding an element to a collection is very similar to standard `Bind Step`_\ s,
but with the addition of one step: calling ``.intoCollection()`` in the builder definition.::

  binder
    .bind([Element.self])                // Bind Step
    .intoCollection()	// indicates that we are providing an
                      // element or elements into Array<Element>**
   [.tagged(with: Tag_For_Element.self)]   // Tag step
   [.asSingleton()]                        // Scope step
   {.to(provider:) |                       // Terminating step
    .to(factory:)  |
    .to(value:)}

The `Terminating Step`_ for this builder sequence can either be a factory/value/provider
of a single ``Element`` or ``Array`` of ``Element``\ s.

Property Injection
``````````````````
There are a few instances where one does not control the construction of an object, but dependency injection would be deemed useful.
Some of the more common occurrences of this are:

- App Delegate: This is required in every iOS app and is the entry point, but UIKit will construct it.
- View Controllers constructed via storyboard (in particular via segues): Yes, we all make mistakes. One of those mistakes
  may have been using Storyboards before they became unwieldy. One does not control the construction of view controllers
  when using storyboards.
- XCTestCase: We don't control how they're instantiated, but may want to access objects from an object graph. This is
  more desirable in higher levels of testing such as UI and integration testing (DI can usually be avoided for lower
  level unit tests)

Cleanse has a solution for this: Property injection (known as Member injection in Guice and Dagger).

In cleanse, Property injection is a second class citizen by design. Factory/Constructor injection should be used wherever
possible, but when it won't property injection may be used. Property Injection has a builder language, similar to the
``BindingBuilder``:

.. code-block:: swift

  binder
    .bindPropertyInjectionOf(<metatype of class being injected into>)
    .to(injector: <property injection method>)

There are two variants of the terminating function, one is where the signature is

.. code-block:: swift

  (Element, P1, P2,  ..., Pn) -> ()

And the other is

.. code-block:: swift

  (Element) -> (P1, P2, ..., Pn) -> ()

The former is to allow for simple injection methods that aren't instance methods, for example:

.. code-block:: swift

  binder
    .bindPropertyInjectionOf(AClass.self)
    .to {
       $0.a = ($1 as TaggedProvider<ATag>).get()
    }

or

.. code-block:: swift

  binder
    .bindPropertyInjectionOf(BClass.self)
    .to {
        $0.injectProperties(superInjector: $1, b: $2, crazyStruct: $3)
    }

The latter type of injection method that can be used (``Element -> (P1, P2,  …, Pn) -> ()``) is convenient
when referring to instant methods on the target for injection.

Say we have

.. code-block:: swift

    class FreeBeer {
      var string1: String!
      var string2: String!

      func injectProperties(
        string1: TaggedProvider<String1>,
        string2: TaggedProvider<String2>
      ) {
        self.string1 = string1.get()
        self.string2 = string2.get()
      }
    }

One can bind a property injection for FreeBeer by doing:

.. code-block:: swift

    binder
      .bindPropertyInjectionOf(FreeBeer.self)
      .to(injector: FreeBeer.injectProperties)

.. Note::

  The result type of the expression ``FreeBeer.injectProperties`` is
  ``FreeBeer -> (TaggedProvider<String1>, TaggedProvider<String2>) -> ()``

After binding a property injector for ``Element``, one will be able to request the type ``PropertyInjector<Element>``
in a factory argument. This has a single method defined as

.. code-block:: swift

  func injectProperties(into instance: Element)

Which will perform property injection into Element

.. Note::

  Property injectors in the non-legacy API are unaware of class hierarchies. If one wants property injection to cascade
  up a class hierarchy, the injector bound may call the inject method for super, or request a
  ``PropertyInjector<Superclass>`` as an injector argument and use that.


Features
--------
Cleanse is work in progress, but already has a powerful feature set. There are some features that other DI frameworks
have which are desired in cleanse.


=================================== =================================
   Feature                          Cleanse Implementation Status
=================================== =================================
Multi-Bindings                      Supported (``.intoCollection()``)
Overrides                           Supported
Objective-C Compatibility layer     Supported (Experimental)
Property Injection [#pinj]_         Supported
Type Qualifiers                     Supported via `Type Tags`_
`Assisted Injection`_ [#assinj]_    TBD
`Subcomponents`_                    TBD
=================================== =================================

.. [#assinj] Assisted Injection will probably take the form of `Subcomponents`_ that can have arguments.
.. [#pinj] Property injection is known as `field injection`_ in other DI frameworks

.. _Assisted Injection: https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/AssistedInject
.. _Subcomponents: http://google.github.io/dagger/subcomponents.html
.. _field injection: https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Injections#field-injection

Another very important part of a DI framework is how it handles errors. Failing fast is ideal. Cleanse is designed to
support fast failure. It currently supports fast failing for some of the more common errors, but it isn't complete

=================================== =================================
   Error Type                       Cleanse Implementation Status
=================================== =================================
Missing Providers                   Supported [#f1]_
Duplicate Bindings                  Supported [#f2]_
Cycle Detection                     TBD (very important to add soon)
=================================== =================================

.. [#f1] When a provider is missing, errors present line numbers, etc. where the provider was required. Cleanse
        will also collect all errors before failing
.. [#f2] Duplicate provider detection could use improvement. It currently throws when duplicate binding is added.
